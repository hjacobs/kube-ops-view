Goal: provide a common operational picture for multiple Kubernetes clusters.

* Render nodes and indicate their overall status ("Ready")
* Show node capacity and resource usage (CPU, memory)

  * Render one "box" per CPU and fill up to sum of pod CPU requests/usage
  * Render vertical bar for total memory and fill up to sum of pod memory requests/usage

* Render individual pods

  * Indicate pod status by border line color (green: ready/running, yellow: pending, red: error etc)
  * Show current CPU/memory usage (gathered from Heapster) by small vertical bars
  * System pods ("kube-system" namespace) will be grouped together at the bottom

* Provide tooltip information for nodes and pods
* Animate pod creation and termination

What it is not:

* It's not a replacement for the `Kubernetes Dashboard`_. The Kubernetes Dashboard is a general purpose UI which allows managing applications.
* It's not a monitoring solution. Use your preferred monitoring system to alert on production issues.
* It's not a operation management tool. Kubernetes Operational View does not allow interacting with the actual cluster.


Usage
=====

Running Locally
---------------

You can run the app locally with ``kubectl proxy`` against your running cluster:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ kubectl proxy &
    $ docker run -it --net=host hjacobs/kube-ops-view

If you are using Docker for Mac, this needs to be slightly different in order to navigate the VM/container inception:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ kubectl proxy --accept-hosts '.*' &
    $ docker run -it -p 8080:8080 -e CLUSTERS=http://docker.for.mac.localhost:8001 hjacobs/kube-ops-view

Now direct your browser to http://localhost:8080

You can also try the UI with the integrated mock mode. This does not require any Kubernetes cluster access:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ docker run -it -p 8080:8080 hjacobs/kube-ops-view --mock

Installation
------------

You can find example Kubernetes manifests for deployment in the ``deploy`` folder.
It should be as simple as:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ kubectl apply -k deploy  # apply all manifests from the folder

Afterwards you can open "kube-ops-view" via kubectl port-forward:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ kubectl port-forward service/kube-ops-view 8080:80

Now direct your browser to http://localhost:8080/

`Kubernetes Operational View is also available as a Helm Chart`_.

Development
===========

The app can be started in "mock mode" to work on UI features without running any Kubernetes cluster:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pipenv install && pipenv shell
    $ (cd app && npm start &)  # watch and compile JS bundle
    $ python3 -m kube_ops_view --mock --debug


Building
========

The provided ``Makefile`` will generate a Docker image by default:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ make


Multiple Clusters
=================

Multiple clusters are supported by passing a list of API servers, reading a kubeconfig file or pointing to an HTTP Cluster Registry endpoint.

See the `documentation on multiple clusters`_ for details.

.. _documentation on multiple clusters: https://kubernetes-operational-view.readthedocs.io/en/latest/multiple-clusters.html


Configuration
=============

The following environment variables are supported:

``AUTHORIZE_URL``
    Optional OAuth 2 authorization endpoint URL for protecting the UI.
``ACCESS_TOKEN_URL``
    Optional token endpoint URL for the OAuth 2 Authorization Code Grant flow.
``SCOPE``
    Optional scope specifies level of access that the application is requesting.
``CLUSTERS``
    Comma separated list of Kubernetes API server URLs. It defaults to ``http://localhost:8001/`` (default endpoint of ``kubectl proxy``).
``CLUSTER_REGISTRY_URL``
    URL to cluster registry returning list of Kubernetes clusters.
``CREDENTIALS_DIR``
    Directory to read (OAuth) credentials from --- these credentials are only used for non-localhost cluster URLs.
``DEBUG``
    Set to "true" for local development to reload code changes.
``KUBECONFIG_PATH``
    Path to kubeconfig file to use for cluster access.
``KUBECONFIG_CONTEXTS``
    Comma separated list of contexts to use when reading the kubeconfig file from ``KUBECONFIG_PATH``.
``MOCK``
    Set to "true" to mock Kubernetes cluster data.
``QUERY_INTERVAL``
    Interval in seconds for querying clusters (default: 5). Each cluster will at most queried once per configured interval.
``REDIS_URL``
    Optional Redis server to use for pub/sub events and job locking when running more than one replica. Example: ``redis://my-redis:6379``
``SERVER_PORT``
    HTTP port to listen on. It defaults to ``8080``.
``NODE_LINK_URL_TEMPLATE``
    Template to make Nodes clickable, e.g. can point to `kube-web-view <https://codeberg.org/hjacobs/kube-web-view/>`_. ``{cluster}`` (cluster ID) and ``{name}`` (Node name) will be replaced in the URL template.
``POD_LINK_URL_TEMPLATE``
    Template to make Pods clickable, e.g. can point to `kube-web-view <https://codeberg.org/hjacobs/kube-web-view/>`_. ``{cluster}`` (cluster ID), ``{namespace}`` (Pod's namespace), and ``{name}`` (Pod name) will be replaced in the URL template.
``ROUTE_PREFIX``
    The URL prefix under which kube-ops-view is externally reachable (for example, if kube-ops-view is served via a reverse proxy). Used for generating relative and absolute links back to kube-ops-view itself. If the URL has a path portion, it will be used to prefix all HTTP endpoints served by kube-ops-view. If omitted, relevant URL components will be derived automatically.

Supported Browsers
==================

The UI uses WebGL, ECMAScript 6, and EventSource features.
The following browsers are known to work:

* Chrome/Chromium 53.0+
* Mozilla Firefox 49.0+

See the `ECMAScript 6 Compatibility Table`_ for details on supported browser versions.
